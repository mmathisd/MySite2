        <div class= first>
            <p>
               I hope you enjoy my submission for the MidTerm Exams of any sort, and it is very
               cruel of you to inflict exams of any kind onto myself and my fellow classmates. 
            </p>
        </div>
            <br>
        <div class= second>
            <p>
              You should be <strong>ashamed</strong> of your cruelty and unfairness.  
            </p>
         </div>
            <br>
        <div class= third>
            <p>
                Really why do we need to take exams anyway? Isn't that sort 
                of an antiquated way of measuring how well we retain information?
