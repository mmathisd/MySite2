            <p> It all started in a Classroom, then I felt like I was good enough to make pictures alive. I was born in 
                San Antonio, Texas. I am definitely no professional, everything just happened. I don't know if people believe
                in my artistic photographic ways. But, they do appreciate my effort. 
                I have always wanted to do something in my life so I picked up a camera and started clicking.
                There is no reason for what I do, I just do it.
